# apparebit.com

This repository contains most of the sources for my personal website
[apparebit.com](https://apparebit.com). The sources for the [.htaccess
configuration](https://github.com/apparebit/server-configs-apache) are in a
separate, public repository. Most typefaces on Apparebit are commercially
licensed and thus not publicly accessible. Git submodules are effective at
isolating them in another, private repository, while still being readily
accessible by myself.

This repository being public does *not* imply that its contents are open source.
I chose to develop in the open to support the open web. But unless otherwise and
explicitly noted, I reserve *all* rights to the contents of this repository. In
particular, I retain the full copyright on *all* writing and images. The one
exception is the privacy policy, which I am making available under the [Creative
Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International
License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). As noted at the top
of the corresponding files, I am also releasing Apparebit’s style sheets and
scripts under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Next, I am
perfectly fine with you copying markup patterns, e.g., the tags and attributes I
use for accessibly marking up articles, sections, figures, and pullquotes.
That’s how we learn from each other on the open web. But please respect my
rights and do not copy, or otherwise reuse, my writing and photography.
