# apparebit.com

This repository contains the sources for my personal website
[apparebit.com](https://apparebit.com). Since Apparebit includes commercially
licensed typefaces, font files are stored in a separate, private repository
(which I access from within this repository as a git submodule). I generate the
finished website with my own
[site:forge](https://github.com/apparebit/siteforge) tool and host it with an
[appropriately configured](https://github.com/apparebit/server-configs-apache)
Apache server.

Given that Apparebit is already publicly accessible, I am also developing the
website in the open. Still, **I reserve all rights for its content including
writing and images**. The only exceptions are:

  * Apparebit's [privacy policy](content/about/privacy.html), which is licensed
    under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) terms.
  * Apparebit's [style sheet](content/assets/form.css), [client-side
    script](content/assets/function.js), and [font subset
    script](script/subset.py), which are licensed under
    [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) terms.

In contrast to Apparebit, the
[site:forge](https://github.com/apparebit/siteforge) tool used to produce the
finished website is open source, licensed under
[MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) terms.
