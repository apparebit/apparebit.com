# apparebit.com

This repository contains most of the sources for my personal website
[apparebit.com](https://apparebit.com). The sources for the [.htaccess
configuration](https://github.com/apparebit/server-configs-apache) are in a
separate, public repository. So are the sources for
[site:forge](https://github.com/apparebit/siteforge), which serves as
Apparebit's static website generator. Most typefaces on Apparebit are
commercially licensed and thus not publicly accessible. Git submodules are
effective at isolating them in another, private repository, while still being
readily accessible by myself.

website generator I am developing in tandem with and support of Apparebit, is
