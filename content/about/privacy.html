<header><h1>Privacy Notice</h1></header>

<section aria-labelledby=overview>
<h2 id=overview hidden>Overview</h2>

<p>This privacy notice explains the data collection and processing practices
relating to <a rel=home href="https://apparebit.com">Apparebit</a>. Seeing that
I, Robert Grimm, reside in the United States of America and that this website is
hosted by an American firm within the United States, the European Union’s <a
href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/2018-reform-eu-data-protection-rules/eu-data-protection-rules_en"><cite>General
Data Protection Regulation</cite></a> only applies to visitors from the
<abbr>EU</abbr>. Nonetheless, Apparebit’s entire data collection and data
processing practices, independent of a visitor’s location, are directly informed
by and fully compliant with <abbr>GDPR</abbr>. This privacy notice serves to
meet the
<em>lawfulness, fairness and transparency</em>
requirements of that regulation and any other applicable laws and
regulations.</p>

<p>Very much in line with <abbr>GDPR</abbr>’s principle of <em>data
minimisation</em>, Apparebit does <em>not</em> collect any personal data. It
does, however, maintain conventional server access logs and may also install
code and data on your computer. The rest of this notice first explains the
operation of this website, then discusses sharing its content to social
networks, and finally outlines basic operational practices. If you have any
questions or concerns about this notice or the practices described, please do
not hesitate to <a rel=me
href="mailto:apparebit@gmail.com?subject=About%20Apparebit's%20Privacy%20Notice">reach
out to me</a>. After all, I am this website’s <em>controller</em>, responsible
for both content and operation.</p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby=access-logs>
<h2 id=access-logs>Accessing Content on Apparebit</h2>

<p>Apparebit maintains conventional server access logs that identify what
resources were accessed at what time and from what location. Logged information
typically includes the <abbr>URL</abbr>, a timestamp with millisecond
resolution, your computer’s <abbr>IP</abbr> address, and your browser. Apparebit
collects that information for three reasons:</p>

<ul class=tight>
<li>To better understand what content you access and how you interact with
the content;</li>
<li>To comply with licensing requirements, notably for commercially licensed
typefaces;</li>
<li>To ensure the security of this website and the integrity of its
content.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above reasons meet not only one but two of the requirements for lawful
data processing as laid out in <abbr>GDPR</abbr>’s Article 6. Specifically, they
are 1.c “compliance with a legal obligation” and 1.f “legitimate interests
persued by the controller.” Yet, despite being well within the limits for lawful
data collection, Apparebit does not collect any personal information.
Furthermore, it does <em>not</em> track your online activities through, say,
“cookies.” It also does <em>not</em> utilize third-party tracking and analytics
services, such as Google Analytics.</p>

<p>If your browser supports it, Apparebit may install a small script, known as a
“<a
href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/resources.html">service
worker,</a>” on your computer. That script may, in turn, download resources from
this website onto your computer. It does not collect any information about you,
your computer, or your use of your computer. Its only purpose is to make your
experience accessing Apparebit a more pleasant one. You can verify that claim
yourself or have somebody with the requisite background do so for you, since the
source code for <a href="https://github.com/apparebit/apparebit.com">Apparebit
is open source</a>.</p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby=social-sharing>
<h2 id=social-sharing>Sharing Content from Apparebit</h2>

<p>This website integrates with other websites, notably social networks, only
minimally. In particular, Apparebit does <em>not</em> embed any third-party
content or services. That is very much intentional because doing so would enable
that third party to track Apparebit’s visitors as well.</p>

<p>This website does, however, link to content on other websites including on
social networks. Apparebit’s privacy practices do <em>not</em> apply, if you
follow such outbound links. Furthermore, this website does contain identifiers
for my social network accounts on Facebook and Twitter. If you share content
from this website to either social network, that network tracks your activity
and makes aggregate information available to me.</p>

<p>Please consult the privacy policies for <a
href="https://www.facebook.com/policy.php">Facebook</a> and <a
href="https://twitter.com/privacy">Twitter</a> for further details.</p>

<section aria-labelledby=data-management>
<h2 id=data-management>Operating Apparebit</h2>

<p>In developing and operating Apparebit, I follow best security practices as
much as possible. That includes using randomized passwords, two-factor
authentication, and only encrypted network channels. The sources for Apparebit
are stored on my own computers and on Github’s servers. I use my own static
website generator called <a
href="https://github.com/apparebit/siteforge">site:forge</a> to produce the
production version, which is then deployed to my hosting provider’s server. Logs
are stored on that server machine and on my desktop computer. Access is
restricted to myself only. Though I do reserve the right to share aggregate
statistics with select third parties, as becomes necessary for development and
operation of this site.</p>
