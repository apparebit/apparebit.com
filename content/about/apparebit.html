<h1>About This Website</h1>
</header>

<section aria-labelledby=introduction>
<div class=heading><h2 id=introduction hidden>Introduction</h2></div>

<p>The name <dfn lang=la translate=no>Apparebit</dfn> is the third-person
singular future active indicative of the Latin verb <i lang=la
translate=no>appareo</i> and translates to “it will appear.” It also is
programmatic: This website started as a showcase for my photography and now also
features my writing. To accommodate that mission growth, I redesigned Apparebit
twice, with each subsequent version being more ambitious than the previous
one.</p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby=history>
<div class=heading><h2 id=history>History</h2></div>

<ol>
<li>The first version of Apparebit featured a rotating cast of photographs under
a couple of headings and was utterly brutalist long before brutalist design
became fashionable. It also fell short on information architecture, semantic
markup, responsiveness, and accessibility. It did, however, feature a deliberate
choice of typeface, Helvetica, an hitherto unacknowledged nod towards my first
conscious use of a typeface, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target=_blank
href="https://www.bertholdtypes.com/font/ag-book/proplus/">Akzidenz-Grotesk
Buch</a>, for a series of posters promoting gay dance parties in my hometown
Würzburg during the late 1980s.</li>

<li>The second version, released in <time datetime=2012-04>April 2012</time>,
was rather <em>serious</em>, presenting my photography as art. Around the time,
I did indeed participate in a couple of group shows and also won an award for my
work. Whereas the first version fell short on best practices, the second version
made up for it and then some. It was semantic, accessible, and most definitely
responsive—with supported browsers ranging from Internet Explorer on the desktop
down to dedicated web views after smartphone installation. Alas, the visual
design itself was bland, utilitarian, and, ahem, skeuomorphic—thanks to an
overindulgence in fine shadows and highlights. Sadly, I removed this imitation
of life only three years later in <time datetime=2015-08>August 2015</time>.
Thereafter, the design was suitably bland, utilitarian, and flat. Huzzah!</li>

<li>The need for another redesign became apparent a couple of years ago. I was
increasingly using Facebook as a <i lang=la translate=no>de facto</i> blog. But
I was also becoming increasingly concerned about blogging in that deeply suspect
environment. Subsequent efforts at completely redesigning Apparebit to
accommodate my writing in addition to my photography while simultaneously
developing my own software for managing the website yielded considerable insight
into overall architecture, visual appearance, typography, and necessary tooling.
But the scope of the effort also was too ambitious to be conducive to
completion. While working on a one-page side project, I realized that the
difference between that self-contained page and a minimum viable Apparebit had
shrunk to a couple of weeks work and went for it. I launched the third version
of Apparebit in <time datetime=2019-08-20>late August 2019</time> and made <a
target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="https://github.com/apparebit/apparebit.com">the source repository
</a> public in <time datetime=2019-09-11>early September 2019</time>. From here
on out, I expect development for Apparebit to take place in the open.</li>
</ol>

<section aria-labelledby=typography>
<div class=heading><h2 id=typography>Typography</h2></div>

<p>Apparebit’s current design features typefaces by contemporary designers from
Argentina, France, and the United States. Body text throughout this website is
set in <a target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="https://www.type-together.com/bely-font">Bely</a> by <a target=_blank
rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.roxanegataud.com">Roxane Gataud</a>,
which is available through <a target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="https://www.type-together.com">TypeTogether</a>. Headings and pullquotes
vary between pages and, in addition to Bely Display, use the following
typefaces:</p>

<ul>
<li><a target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="https://djr.com/notes/bild-widths-font-of-the-month/">Bild</a> designed by
<a target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://djr.com">David Jonathan
Ross</a> and released through his <a target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="https://fontofthemonth.club">Font of the Month Club</a>;</li>

<li><a target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="http://phantom-foundry.com/project/bluu-suuperstar">Bluu Suuperstar</a>
designed by <a target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="http://phantom-foundry.com">Jean-Baptiste Morizot</a> and released through
<a target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="https://black-foundry.com">Black Foundry</a>;</li>

<li><a target=_blank rel="noreferrer
noopener" href="https://pampatype.com/reforma">Reforma 2018</a>
designed by <a target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="https://twitter.com/alelocelso?lang=en">Alejandro Lo Celso</a> and
released under the <a target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">Creative Commons
<abbr>BY-ND</abbr> 4.0</a> license.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, the website logo and icon use the stenciled version of <a
target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="https://www.futurefonts.xyz/phantom-foundry/super-fat-bob">Super Fat
Bob</a> also designed by <a target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="http://phantom-foundry.com">Jean-Baptiste Morizot</a> and released through
<a target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="https://www.futurefonts.xyz">FutureFonts</a>.</p>

<p>FutureFonts and Ross’ Font of the Month Club are great resources for new type
designs. Their typefaces may not come in as many variants as those in more
conventional outlets and they may also be very much in-progress. But they are
always interesting and fresh. They also tend to be affordable, while providing
some measure of a steady income to independent type designers. A win-win for all
parties involved!</p>
