<h1>About This Website</h1>
</header>

<section aria-labelledby=introduction>
<div class=heading><h2 id=introduction hidden>Introduction</h2></div>

<p>I started this website during the late oughts as a more personal outlet
separate from my professional, academic homepage. The name <dfn lang=la
translate=no>Apparebit</dfn> is the third-person singular future active
indicative of the Latin verb <i lang=la translate=no>appareo</i> and translates
to “it will appear.” The choice of name is programmatic: The website started as
a showcase for my photography. Its mission has since expanded to include my
writing as well. Apparebit has seen two major redesigns, covering information
architecture, content, and appearance—with each redesign also being far more
ambitious than the previous version.</p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby=history>
<div class=heading><h2 id=history>History</h2></div>

<ol>
<li>The first version of Apparebit featured a rotating cast of photographs under
a couple of headings and was rather simplistic—falling short on information
architecture, semantic markup, accessibility, and responsiveness. It also was an
exercise in brutalist design long before brutalist design became fashionable.
Quite possibly, that was a late effect of forays into graphic design during my
late teens. At the time, I was experimenting with found images and found type,
creating printed matter as well as t-shirts. Those efforts culminated in my
first conscious use of a typeface, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target=_blank
href="https://www.bertholdtypes.com/font/ag-book/proplus/">Akzidenz-Grotesk
Buch</a>, for a series of posters promoting gay dance parties in my hometown
Würzburg. With my education demanding ever more of my attention, my design
exploits went on hiatus shortly thereafter. But an affinity for (neo-)grotesque
type and clean sans serif forms persisted until fairly recently.</li>

<li>The second version, released in <time datetime=2012-04>April 2012</time>,
was rather <em>serious</em>, presenting my photography as art. I did indeed
participate in a couple of group shows and also won an award for my work at the
time. Where the first version fell short on best practices, the second version
made up for it and then some. It was semantic, accessible, and
responsive—seamlessly scaling from smartphone screens to desktop monitors. It
religiously adhered to a vertical rhythm, went out of its way to support
Internet Explorer, and could even be installed as a smartphone app. Alas, its
design also was bland and utilitarian. Worse, it suffered from an overly
generous application of shadows, gradients, and highlights. I removed those
imitations of light in <time datetime=2015-08>August 2015</time>. Thereafter,
Apparebit’s design was flat, bland, and utilitarian.</li>

<li>The need for a third version became apparent a couple of years ago. I was
using Facebook as a <i lang=la translate=no>de facto</i> blog, commenting on
art, technology, and politics—plus the occasional cat pictures. I had also
published <a href="/features/ubu-trump">a first long-form article</a> on this
website. Seeking to make Apparebit my primary outlet, I set out for a new design
as well as new software. I expanded my knowledge about graphics and typography,
conducted countless visual experiments and studies, and explored different
approaches to software tooling. While very instructive, the scope of these
efforts was too broad and thus got in the way of actually producing a result.
While writing and designing my article about Facebook, I realized that what I
had originally conceived as an independent project really was putting the
finishing touches on my full website redesign. That doesn’t mean the redesign is
complete. Notably, my photography still is missing. But I have a robust and
appealing foundation for presenting my work.</li>

<div class=heading><h2 id=typography>Typography</h2></div>

<p>Apparebit’s design features typefaces by contemporary designers from
Argentina, France, and the United States. Body text throughout this website is
set in <a target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="https://www.type-together.com/bely-font">Bely</a> by <a target=_blank
rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.roxanegataud.com">Roxane Gataud</a>,
which is available through <a target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="https://www.type-together.com">TypeTogether</a>. Headings and pullquotes
vary between pages and, in addition to Bely Display, use the following
typefaces:</p>

<ul>
<li><a target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="https://djr.com/notes/bild-widths-font-of-the-month/">Bild</a> designed by
<a target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://djr.com">David Jonathan
Ross</a> and released through his <a target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="https://fontofthemonth.club">Font of the Month Club</a>;</li>

<li><a target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="http://phantom-foundry.com/project/bluu-suuperstar">Bluu Suuperstar</a>
designed by <a target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="http://phantom-foundry.com">Jean-Baptiste Morizot</a> and released through
<a target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="https://black-foundry.com">Black Foundry</a>;</li>

<li><a target=_blank rel="noreferrer
noopener" href="https://pampatype.com/reforma">Reforma 2018</a>
designed by <a target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="https://twitter.com/alelocelso?lang=en">Alejandro Lo Celso</a> and
released under the <a target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">Creative Commons
<abbr>BY-ND</abbr> 4.0</a> license.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, the website logo and icon use the stenciled version of <a
target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="https://www.futurefonts.xyz/phantom-foundry/super-fat-bob">Super Fat
Bob</a> also designed by <a target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="http://phantom-foundry.com">Jean-Baptiste Morizot</a> and released through
<a target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"
href="https://www.futurefonts.xyz">FutureFonts</a>.</p>

<p>FutureFonts and Ross’ Font of the Month Club are great resources for new type
designs. Their typefaces may not come in as many variants as those in more
conventional outlets and they may also be very much in-progress. But they are
always interesting and fresh. They also tend to be affordable, while providing
some measure of a steady income to independent type designers. A win-win for all
parties involved!</p>
