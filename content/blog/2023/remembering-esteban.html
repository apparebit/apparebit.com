<section aria-labelledby=introduction>
<h2 id=introduction hidden>Introduction</h2>

<p>19 years ago, my then partner declared “you need a kitten!” A few weeks
later, he informed me that he had found the perfect kitten on Craigslist. We
headed from <abbr>NYU</abbr>’s faculty housing in the center of the Village over
to the guy’s home in the West Village. The guy had found the kitten, desperate
for food and attention, in a Harlem stoop garden the night before but wasn’t
ready to commit to becoming a cat gay. Alas, the visit didn’t go well. Both
kitten and I were skittish and scared of each other. After heading out
empty-handed, my then partner piped up. This was a mistake, he said. He was
ready to go back and take the kitten home with him himself. After some back and
forth, we went back, took the kitten, and headed home.</p>

<p>As I found out the hard way years later, cat adoptions in New York City
almost never are that easy. They require letters of reference, home visits, and
window screens. Though as I also found out the hard way, you may be able to skip
the window screens. But only if you live in a landmarked building. That’s
because there is one organization that’s more powerful than the crazy cat ladies
who hold a monopoly on cat adoptions in <abbr>NYC</abbr>. Even they bow before
the New York City’s Landmarks Protection Commission. Really: My adoption of
Prince David had been on hold for weeks due to window screens. It was approved
within 30 minutes of me pointing out my building’s landmark status!</p>

</figure>

<p>But back to that fateful day. Once home, I let the kitten loose in my bedroom
and, whoosh, it vanished underneath the bed, into the corner furthest from our
reach. With the space under the bed packed with boxes for computer, stereo
components, lamps, and the like, the kitten had probably counted on being well
out of reach. So when we just slid the mattress to the side and approached its
hideaway from above, it stared at us from underneath the slats, startled and in
fear. My then partner was not impressed by its state and was about to rudely
grab it and pull it out.</p>

<p>Recognizing just a hint of that famous curiosity in the kitten’s demeanor, I
stopped him and gave the kitten time and space to come out out on its own terms.
I started whispering words of encouragement, and soon enough, the kitten pushed
up, poking its head through the gap between slats, and a moment later pulled
down again. Some moments later, another attempt. Up and back down again. Up and
down. Over time, the kitten came up higher and higher. I got to touch it. It
came up longer and longer. And eventually, it just stayed up and curled into my
arm, purring up a storm. That’s how we imprinted on each other. He the love of
my life, me the bitch of his life!</p>

<h2 id=kitten-days>Days of the Kitten</h2>

<p>The first vet visit went well. We had picked up a girl, Anyanka Mathilde
Grimm — Anyanka after Buffy’s friend, a former vengeance demon, and Mathilde
after my mother’s mother. The first bloodwork also went well. Much to my relief,
she was free of viral nasties, including <abbr>FIV</abbr>. The second vet visit
a few weeks later was interesting. She really was a he, the vet said, his bad.
Well hello, Esteban Otto Grimm: You are named after three generations of Esteban
in Pedro Almodovar’s <cite>All About My Mother</cite>—sorry for deadnaming you,
Lola!—and three generations of Otto in the Grimm family, including me.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we live in a state where the first gender impression isn’t
permanently binding and so Esteban got gender-appropriate medical treatment all
his life. It matters. For instance, there is a difference of procedure between
spaying and neutering. As it happens, I didn’t time that appointment quite right
and Esteban went into heat the night before the neutering. Nobody got any sleep
that night, what with Esteban racing through the apartment, scaling off walls,
and screaming at the top of his astonishingly powerful lungs. He was so much
better 24 hours later—chop, chop—without balls!</p>

<p>Other than that crazy night, Esteban was one cool kitten. He kept himself
entertained by exploring the heights of the apartment—the climb up Mount Living
Room Bookshelf ended in a book slide but the route up Mount Cupboard above the
Range became part of his exercise regime. From valley floor up on the Eastern
Counter Ridge onto the Fridge Summit and then a daring jump across the entire
valley onto the Western Cupboard summit. Once up there, Esteban would position
himself next to Godzilla and the two would stare down at us puny humans.</p>

<p>Besides climbing, Esteban also was an avid soccer player. He even invented a
new variant that can be easily played by a team of one. All you need to do is
bring the ball into a bath tub with the shower curtain drawn. Since that’s just
how I usually left it, Esteban would spend many a night kicking the ball up
high. Thanks to the setup, the ball would always bounce right back into the tub
and roll towards Esteban, who’d kick the ball again and so on, all through the
night.</p>

<p>Despite his busy athletic schedule, Esteban also was an exceedingly cuddly
cat. As soon as I reclined in a comfortable position in the living room, he’d
come and climb up on my chest to cuddle. All I had to do was offer one arm as
support and use the other to pet him. He loved every minute of it every single
time, purring loudly—until he had enough, climbed down, and curled up next to
me. It was during one of those cuddle sessions that I wrote a song just for him:
“I love you. You love me. Let’s go outside and pee on a tree.” I still don’t
understand why the song didn’t make the Billboard Hot 100 upon release!</p>
</div>

<!--<aside class=pullquote>

  <span>You love me.</span>

  <span>and pee</span> <span>on a tree.”</span></span></p>
</aside>-->

<p>While we never went outside and peed on a tree, Esteban and I did venture to
Brooklyn together, nominally for a play date with my then partner’s cat, King
Arthur. Still a kitten, Esteban was so chill that I could just take him with me,
just holding him, no harness, no leash. He loved every minute of it, enjoying
the view from my chest while we drove over the Brooklyn Bridge and, a little
later, exploring every nook and cranny of my then partner’s studio. In fact, he
was so focused on exploring, he completely ignored the purpose of the visit,
playing with King. I guess it didn’t help that King kept following Esteban at
some distance, hissing nonstop.</p>

</figure>

<p>The play date for King at my place a few weeks later wasn’t much of a play
date either. King took one look at the unfamiliar surroundings and vanished
underneath the sofa. Neither words, treats, arms, or broom stick could convince
King to come out again. He stayed put underneath the sofa—until about 24 hours
later, when he emerged and acted like he had always lived there. That way, King
moved in with me months before my then partner. Those disastrous play dates
notwithstanding, King and Esteban became inseparable. They played together. They
ate together. They slept together. They founded the Feline Liberation Front
(<abbr>FLF</abbr>) together. I’m still a bit unclear about the
<abbr>FLF</abbr>’s goals and activities but people in the know tell me that the
State Department came rather close to officially designating the Feline
Liberation Front as a terrorist organization. Something about feline supremacy
and infecting every human with <i lang=la>toxoplasmosis gondii</i> to make us
more beholden to cats.</p>
</div>

<p>Frankly, I find that a bit hard to believe. While King was not adverse to
utilizing biological weapons more or less on a whim, Esteban was a people
person, ahem, cat. The only thing Esteban ever attacked during his life were
those boxes underneath the bed. We heard him tear through them at night. But I
didn’t think much of it because there was no visible damage. At least, as far as
I could tell, peaking under the bed from the side. Hah! When I needed them for
my move to Brooklyn, I realized that all that was left were the visible parts,
towards the side. He had completely shredded the rest, leaving just a pile of
scraps.</p>

<h2 id=community>Esteban, Community Organizer</h2>

<p>Esteban discovered his love for human attention when I extended our daily
fetch sessions to the hallway outside the apartment. It all came together rather
organically. Throwing the ball far enough meant throwing the ball from living
room through hallway or kitchen (which really was a second hallway next to the
actual hallway) into the entrance area and then back again. Well, at some point,
I just opened the apartment door and started throwing the ball out into the
building hallway. The boys loved it. They loved it even more when I started
staging laser shows in the hallway.</p>

<p>Pretty soon, the neighbors got curious about the racket outside their
apartment doors. And once they saw what was going on, they called their children
and those youngins were plainly ecstatic about cats, real live cats being right
there in the hallway. Of course, they wanted to play with them. Esteban loved
it. He basked in all the attention and easily forgave when the youngest of the
youngins didn’t quite know what “gentle” meant at first. In stark contrast, King
thought them all too much. At the first hint of another door opening, he’d bolt
back into the apartment and observe the ensuing dance of the baby banshees from
just far enough so that he could see everything while still being just outside
people’s reach.</p>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile, Esteban was only getting started. He really came into his own
after we moved to Brooklyn to our own place at One Hanson Place—well, New York
City real estate being <abbr>NYC</abbr> real estate, 0.3% of that place. Well
before that move, my then partner had also moved into my old apartment and it
was truly great until it wasn’t anymore. So the move to Brooklyn also was a
separation. In a textbook case of hoisting with his own petard, my former
partner’s attempt at claiming Esteban for himself by declaring that “The cats
must not be separated!” resulted in King also moving with Esteban and me.
Esteban took to the new apartment and of course the hallway outside in no
time.</p>

<p>For the first several years after we moved into the newly renovated building,
the 15<sup>th</sup> floor differed from other floors in that we neighbors living
on the same floor formed a real community. It sure helped that two more units
were also owned by gay men. But more than anyone and anything, the one who
created that community, who introduced everyone to each other, and who insisted
that everyone be a part was Esteban. He quickly picked up if the owner was
allergic or shared their premises with a dog, giving them their space. But
everyone else was fair game and, if the door was open, their apartment too. He’d
visit. He’d explore. He’d chill. And he’d exercise—by seeking out the highest
accessible place, usually the top of a door, all 2.5cm or 1inch of it, a feat he
not only pulled off repeatedly at my place but also in 15D.</p>

<figcaption>Esteban’s base of operations</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Esteban was particularly fond of 15K, then occupied by a lovely couple and
their newlyborn twin sons. For years, while the twins’ pram was parked in the
hallway next to their door, it served as Esteban’s  base of operations, where
he’d hang out and also sleep. When their apartment door was open, he’d stroll
right in and head to the twins’ bedroom, making himself comfortable under,
behind, or in one of their beds. King didn’t change his mind about building
hallways and never ventured far from the door—except that one time when he too
came to visit 15D and, while the humans were busy talking, proceeded to pee all
over Malik’s pile of dirty workout clothes—as a laughing Malik told me over the
phone a few minutes after we had left.</p>
</div>

<p>Over the years, the owners of 15D and 15K unfortunately moved on, but that
didn’t impress Esteban. He continued to consider the apartments very much part
of his domain. Malik tells of a contractor who called somewhat frantically
because a cat just walked into the apartment while it was being restored after
major flooding and wouldn’t be shooshed out again. Malik advised the contractor
to just let him be; he would leave when he had enough, which he did. After he
sold, I met the new owners standing outside their apartment, facing the door and
not knowing what to do because between them and the door was Esteban, patiently
waiting for them to finally open the door.</p>

<p>Another time, I was rushing to get ready for a meeting and made sure David,
who had opened the apartment door <em>again</em>, was back inside before locking
the door. I didn’t see Esteban and just assumed he was inside. Three hours
later, the doorman called to let me know that my cat was at my neighbors’.
Assuming he met the young escape artist, I reassured him that said cat was long
home. When I finally thought to look for Esteban, he was nowhere to be found. He
wasn't in the hallway either, but the door to 15C was propped open. In the
apartment, I found two very amused tenants who had been watching Esteban
thoroughly explore their apartment from floor to reachable tables, counters, and
shelves. Apparently, I overlooked him in my rush and he just meowed at doors
until somebody took him in.</p>

<p>Quite a bit weirder was what happened in the hallway one late evening in
2021. In fact, it was so weird, the story is best told in reverse, from its
ending. For that grand finale, Esteban was trotting down the hallway, loudly
battle-yodeling—imagine a feline take on <a rel=noreferrer

cry</a> from Hollywood Westerns or Leon Thomas’ inspired

yodeling</a> delivered in a rhythmic staccato—and chasing a family of four, who
were genuinely terrified of him, trying hard to make into their apartment before
he got there.</p>

<p>Moments before that unlikely chase, I had been sitting on the floor outside
my apartment, face mask on, reading and listening to music on my
noise-cancelling headphones. The cats were roaming about the hallway. When I
noticed some movement to my right, I was a bit slow to react because apartments
and passenger elevators are in the other direction and I hadn’t seen anyone head
down to the laundry room. When I did turn, I found the entire family by then
living in 15K, frozen midstep, staring at me with obvious alarm. Quite clearly,
they had taken the scenic route up, using the service elevator, to minimize the
likelihood of neighborly contact and had counted on no one being in the hallway
thanks to the late hour. They also were not receptive to my gestured invitation
to just keep walking by. I had to get up and go inside my apartment before they
would pass. When I noticed that Esteban, unlike David, hadn’t come back inside,
I stepped outside again and found the Great Chase well under way, with that
family fleeing from a house cat as if he was an apex predator ten times his
size.</p>

<p><em>Good boy!</em>—I didn’t say that. But I certainly thought it. And I can’t
claim that I was in any hurry to intervene.</p>

<p>As to Esteban, his battle-yodeling was reserved for situations when he was
worked up and going somewhere. That is consistent with him heading towards one
of his favorite haunts, 15K. It also is consistent with him chasing the parents
out of spite, for revenge. This is not the first time they have been unduly
paranoid about infectious diseases. And that first time, they took it out on
him. Right after moving in, they introduced themselves by complaining about the
cats’ presence in the hallway in general and Esteban’s attempts at entering
their apartment specifically. As justification, they uttered some nonsense about
her being pregnant and trying hard not to get infected with toxoplasmosis.</p>

<figcaption>Cat in the box</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Never mind that it is rather presumptuous—and mighty rude—to just treat my
cats as diseased. Also, only recent infections with toxoplasmosis put a baby at
risk and those won’t be found in indoor cats. Even free range cats mostly pose
an indirect danger. You’ll have to handle days-old poop and ingest some of it as
well to actually be at risk of infection. However, before you claim that you’d
never do that, consider whether you ever played in a sandbox. No wonder that
about a quarter of Americans are already infected with that parasite. Still, I
ignored their paranoid imposition and, to keep the neighborly peace, mostly
curtailed hallway time from then on out, much to Esteban’s dismay. It took him
months to give up on trying to leave with me every time I headed for the
door.</p>
</div>

<p>By the time of the chase, I had softened my enforcement somewhat for two
reasons: First, Prince David, King’s successor in the royal household and evil
genius, had taught himself how to open the rather heavy steel apartment door and
had been heading into the hallway more or less at will. It took Esteban a while
to notice what David had been up to. But once he did, Esteban reliably followed
in David’s wake. With both cats so clearly enjoying their hallway adventures and
Esteban immediately taking up his old routine of patrolling the entire length of
the corridor again, I didn’t want to deprive them of that experience.</p>

<p>Second, the family in 15K had taken to the covid pandemic by taking out their
paranoia on their neighbors again. Not only were they refusing to share the
elevator—no matter that everyone was masked—but they also made other people
wait. After being at the receiving end of this equally entitled and unhinged
behavior a couple of times, I couldn’t be bothered to take their needs into
account anymore. While I avoided hallway time during days and early evenings,
late evenings and night time were fair game. That’s just why I was sitting on
the floor outside my apartment while Esteban and David were roaming about in the
hallway that night.</p>

<p>In other words, Esteban not only had good reason to hold a grudge against the
parents, with them all turning up in the hallway, he also had the perfect
opportunity to turn their paranoia against themselves. Even if he didn’t intend
to, he played the situation beautifully. His battle-yodeling was a particularly
fine touch: As they were nervously fumbling with keys, he provided constant
reminder that he was getting closer and closer. He might have succeeded getting
into the apartment, but I reached him before that eventuality did occur and
brought him back to the area outside my door. He stayed there for a while. But
when the father walked past again on his way to the service elevator, Esteban
resumed his chase, this time in the other direction…</p>
</div>

<hr>

<p>As my gleeful tone makes ample clear, I much enjoyed the great chase, I enjoy
telling its tale, and I feel zero guilt or shame for that. It’s the best kind of
<i lang=de>Schadenfreude</i> because that family inflicted all the midmotion
freezing, the stressing and panicking, the frightful rushing from a household
cat to themselves. At the same time, they have all they need to cope differently
within easy reach. He earns his living as a psychiatrist. So he should have
knowledge and skills to develop a more reasoned and reasonable approach to
coping with disease. But instead they take it out on others. Having said that, I
do feel sorry for the children. With overprotective parents like that, their
pandemic experience must have been an even more claustrophobic hell than it was
for all of us.</p>

<p>The family has since moved to the suburbs. I hope that gives the children
opportunity and space for finding their own way, far from the clutches of those
parents. However, even though the tenants of 15K have changed, the cats
predicament hasn’t and they still can’t roam at will. In my first conversation
with the new tenants, a young straight couple, she impressed on me the severity
of her cat allergies. Ok. I heard her. We know the drill. I cut down on hallway
time and made sure there are no more breakouts during days and evenings. But
then two weeks later, when I see her and greet her, she responds with a cheerful
“Where are the cats?”—uhm what? So is she severely allergic or not? I’m getting
mixed signals here. But I also don’t care to find out more. We have kept our
distance since that interaction and I’ll be minimizing all contact until one of
us moves out.</p>

<p>Even weirder, I have encountered the opposite behavior as well. A guest with
an acknowledged cat allergy was developing obvious signs of resparatory
discomfort but insisted on staying put. I had to tell him “You have to leave.
<em>Now!</em>&thinsp;” I may have threatened him with calling an ambulance as
well. Why would anyone put themselves through that? I don’t even want to watch a
similar occurrence again. For that reason, I now stock allergy medication. It
made a difference once already. Still, I’m puzzled by people exaggerating or
trivializing their allergies. It serves no one, including themselves, and by
putting other people in distinctly uncomfortable or untenable situations such
behavior is bound to backfire.</p>

<section>
<h2>The Troubles</h2>

<p>I’ve gotten pretty far ahead of Esteban’s story. Let’s return, for now, to
the days when King Arthur was still heading the royal household. Just like the
relationship between me and my former partner, Esteban’s and King’s relationship
was truly great until it wasn’t anymore. The Troubles started one dark and
stormy night. I was busy with a friend in the other bedroom and heard them make
a racket for a short while. But that wasn’t that unusual and, as I said, I was
preoccupied. I still have no idea what set them off that night. The vet’s theory
is that King freaked out because of the thunderstorm and blamed Esteban for all
that thunder and lightning right outside the window.</p>

<p>Be that as may. Fact is that I found King in the bathroom in the morning,
trembling and peeing on himself (even though the litter box was barely a foot
away). He was that upset and only relaxed a bit after the vet gave him a valium
later on. From that day on, if Esteban came even remotely close to King, even
when each cat was in their own cage, King would flip out, growling and hissing
nonstop. As you can probably guess, Esteban wasn’t particularly impressed. But
he wasn’t particularly friendly either, getting ready to pounce instead.</p>

<p>With the Troubles thusly in their hot phase, I had little choice but to split
the apartment into two. Taking King’s far more fragile constitution into
account, my bedroom became King’s domain and the rest of the apartment
Esteban’s. I did make a point to spend as much time with Esteban as I could.
Still, he was heartbroken about being locked out from the bedroom and spent
hours howling outside the door. It was horrible. But there was little I could
do. I did try to find King a new home but no one was interested in adopting a
middle-aged cat with a taste for biological warfare. And so the cold phase of
the Troubles became routine.</p>

</figure>

<p>After many months of this, Esteban and King—thankfully—showed signs that
rapprochement might be possible. When I was a bit slow to close the bedroom door
again, they’d both come up, were sniffing each other, and were <em>ok</em> with
each other. After allowing for more of these short encounters and them behaving
similarly, I tried some closely supervised play sessions and, when they too went
well, increasingly left the door open—as long as I was home. Before long, I
relented even on that, starting with short trips to the store before leaving
them alone for hours. After maybe two years total, it seemed that the Troubles
were finally over again.</p>
</div>

<p>Well, kind of. King and Esteban never recovered the closeness they once
shared. And while they did share the bed with me at night again, I served a role
not unlike the Berlin Wall as a strict and rather arbitrary border. Esteban
slept on my left side and King slept on my right side. Neither would dare climb
over the wall at night, though King usually came to his resting place via the
territory of the class enemy. Since neither cat was averse to sitting on my
chest, said wall might function as joint security area as well. Frankly, the
wall enjoyed this dual purpose role.</p>

</figure>

<p>Alas, my relief about the restoration of feline cohabitation soon gave way to
a depression that was so all-encompassing and deep, I came far too close to
ending myself. The primary trigger was medication I had been taking without
issues for many years, so neither my doctor nor myself were watching out for
signs of this known side effect, at least not anymore. By October 2017, I was so
far gone, I didn’t have the wherewithal to seek help despite knowing full well
how bad I was. All I could do is try to keep on going.</p>

<p>I held onto life thanks largely to the cats and Facebook (really!). The cats
were providing physical presence and constancy, whereas Facebook provided a
readily accessible forum for sharing my writing. And I was writing, writing
about anything and everything, writing like my life depended on it. That’s how I
discovered I could write. Alas, it was a nurse practitioner in my doctor’s
office who saved my life. We had previously bonded over a moment of somewhat
inappropriate bedside manner that left us both laughing long and hard. So during
a routine phone call, Abby picked up on me not being right, asked pointed
questions, and helped me make urgently needed changes that same day.
<em>Thank you, Abby!</em></p>
</div>

<p>Those changes, of course, included taking me off that medication. The impact
wasn’t immediate. My body took two days to flush most of the stuff out of my
system. Hence during the afternoon of the second day, in the course of just a
couple of hours, I could feel the depression lifting from me. It was as if an
all-encompassing, entirely black, heavy felt that had been dulling and dampening
all sensation was slowly but definitely dissolving. When it was done, by the end
of the afternoon, I wasn’t just feeling better, lighter, I was dancing on the
street. Really!</p>

<p>Despite the outcome, the experience of that drug losing its hold on my affect
was one of the more unsettling and traumatic experiences of my life. No thank
you! Worse is the knowledge that the pharmaceutical company making that drug
held back more effective and less toxic alternatives for years, so that it could
maximize its stranglehold on the <abbr>US</abbr> market for even longer.
Furthermore, it ruthlessly exploits that leverage by charging over three times
more than it does in other Western countries, notably Europe.</p>

<p>As I was slowly recovering over the next few months, King was rapidly
declining. By February 2018, any hope that he might recover again was vanishing,
just as his body was increasingly vanishing as well. After consulting with
friends on Facebook and listening to their stories about last days spent with
their old and sick cats and dogs, I made the heart-wrenching call to ease King’s
journey to the <i>Great Catnip Fields</i>. Sparing King a stressful trip out of
the house, the then owner of my vet practice agreed to come to my place on
Monday, February 19, 2018 a little after 6pm.</p>

<p>I wrote the previous paragraph on the subway, without referencing notes or
some such. Yet I don’t remember dates, at all. There’s only three I can tell you
off the top of my head: My own birthday (which would be hard to forget), my
sister’s birthday (which conveniently happened two years minus one week later),
and my closest friend’s birthday (which conveniently coincides with the United
States gaining independence, by day of year only). That King’s date of passing
now is the fourth tells you something about its impact.</p>

<p>Knowing that King harbors a deep love for string music, I spent the weekend
buying and setting up speakers for the bedroom and then making a playlist that
focuses on the revelatory and sacred:</p>

<ul class=tight>
<li>Terry Riley’s <cite>One Earth, One People, One Love</cite>, performed by
Kronos Quartet and featuring astronaut <a
href="https://www.nasa.gov/astronautprofiles/cernan">Gene Cernan</a> reflecting
on seeing Earth from above.</li>

<li><cite>Ladilikan</cite>, a song by the griot, that is, praise singers Trio Da
Kali from Mali with support by Kronos Quartet.</li>

<li>Philip Glass’ opera <cite>Satyagraha</cite> about Mahatma Gandhi, sung in
Sanskrit.</li>

<li>Giovanni Battista Pergolesi’s <cite>Stabat Mater</cite>, a hymn to Our
Mother of Sorrows in twelve movements, sung in Latin and written on his
deathbed.</li>

<li>A selection of my favorite pieces by Meredith Monk, mostly sung without
words, including Björk’s take on <cite>Gotham Lullaby</cite> from 2005.</li>

<li>Terry Riley’s <cite>One Earth, One People, One Love</cite> as an
encore.</li>
</ul>

<p>Out of these stand-out pieces, Björk’s performance is particularly dear to
me. It is both a faithful recreation of Meredith’s original and Björk’s own
unique interpretation. It also happens to be a recording of Björk’s only public
performance in 2005. Finally, if you listen carefully, you can clearly discern
yours truly’s delighted whoops amongst the applause afterwards. Admittedly, it
did help that I was sitting in first row center a mere 2m (6.5ft) from Björk. I
categorically deny the rumor that Carnegie Hall has a pristine, high fidelity
recording of all four hours of Making Music: Meredith Monk. Why would they
organize such an amazing event, record every minute of it with studio-quality
recording equipment, and then just keep those recordings to themselves?</p>

<p>King and Esteban loved it. They had forgotten all about the Troubles and
spent the day curled up next to each other, and me, on the same side of the bed.
Sure, each of us got up to eat or for a bathroom break once in a while. But just
like Making Music kept on going for four hours without interruption or break, we
kept on going, fully immersed in some of the most beautiful music wo·man ever
created for most of the day. The previous days had been rough for King, full of
discomfort and pain. He spent much of them under the bed and on the cool
bathroom counter. But Monday was different: King stayed with us all day and
cherished every minute of it. Shortly after the last sounds of Terry Riley's
encore had played, with all three of us still in a trance, Dr Farmer arrived.
King didn’t even get up and passed peacefully right there, on our bed.</p>

<h2 id=feline-behavior>Feline Behavior</h2>

<p>King’s death hit Esteban and me hard. We both were grieving for months. But
it also brought us even closer. Esteban would hardly part from my side
thereafter until the end of his life, regularly following me to the bathroom
even. When I was working at my desk, Esteban would join me, sleeping right next
to me—or at least be close-by, on our bed. For hours, he’d hold onto my left
hand, one paw holding on from below and one paw holding on from atop, with his
head resting on my hand. It didn’t bother him that I was moving my hand while
typing. And it didn’t bother my left wrist that there was noticeable weight
pushing down on it while typing. When we snuggled, it was mostly in bed. That’s
also where I noticed that I was developing distinctly feline behavior patterns,
turning my head away from him and nestling it between arms. He loved that and,
loudly purring, would insert his paws between my arms and join me in a close
snuggle.</p>

</figure>

<p>When we humans face each other directly and distort our faces, eyes wide and
teeth baring, we usually call that a happy smile. When we also open our arms
wide, we consider that especially welcoming, a gesture usually reserved only for
our closest friends and family (and also comrades for those of us who haven’t
given up on wo·man deserving better than eternal, individualized struggle). It
also serves as overture to getting physically closer and wrapping our arms
around each other. Cats don’t work that way. Quite the opposite: Full frontal
faces with bared teeth are a sign of violent aggression. Now, the vast majority
of cats co-habitating with humans, Esteban amongst them, learn to live with us
behaving like we are all nuts, totally nuts. But that doesn’t mean they like it.
And in moments like these, I was meeting Esteban on his terms, one cat to
another, ready to snuggle. He loved it. Every single time.</p>

<p>That also explains that one time during a board meeting of the House
Foundation at my place, when Esteban strolled past the dozen or so people seated
around my living room table and jumped straight onto Meredith Monk’s lap—even
though she was the only person in the room severely allergic to cats and the
least welcoming. That is, to a human, her body language signaled apprehension,
possibly even dismay. To Esteban, she clearly was the least threatening and
probably the most excited to snuggle. So he jumped. Oops! By the time I got back
from picking up dinner for everyone, Meredith was gone, chased away by Esteban.
Thusly ended my time serving on that board. Nonetheless, Esteban can lay claim
to having sat on Meredith Monk’s lap, if only for a short moment. He was that
special!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my life was to become even more unsettled than it already was.
Leaving academia for industry four years before King’s death has been very much
double-edged as far as life-altering decisions go. I’ve learned a lot and
contributed to some really cool software systems. I’ve also experienced
astounding incompetence, often lurking behind cargo-cultish adherence to the <i
lang=la>status quo</i>, and far too much deeply problematic as well as clearly
unethical behavior. As far as the latter is concerned, my year working for
Facebook marks an astounding low. It’s not that I didn’t know I was walking into
a shitshow. <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180317131953/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html">News
about Cambridge Analytica</a> had broken just a couple of months before. But my
positive experience with the social network at one of the low points of my life
created considerable good will on my part and exploratory conversations with
people at the firm left an impression of genuine commitment to do better.
Notably, I came in hot to a conversation with a firm <abbr>VP</abbr> and it
still was very productive, even lasting double the alloted time.</p>
</div>

<p>Alas, as became obvious over my year of working there, Facebook is less a
corporation operating in a democracy than the contemporary successor to East
Germany’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi"><i lang=de>Stasi</i></a>
run for profit as a social impact cult. The cult part was obvious from the first
day. It triggered me into keeping my distance from the indigenous population and
devoting significant resources towards anthropological observation, which played
an important role in <a href="https://youtu.be/iYJQSfQGDEE">my invited talk</a>
about the firm at a major academic conference in 2020.</p>

<p>The violative parts weren’t quite so obvious. The New York Times helped bring
some of them to light during my employment and thereby hastened my exit a year
after signing on. Particularly galling was Sheryl Sandberg’s smear campaign of
Facebook-financed editorials against George Soros. When my observation that
Facebook bans users engaging in such inauthentic coordinated activity was read
but otherwise ignored by her team, I took to stating “I blame George Soros” in
discussions about things that had gone wrong at work.</p>

<p>Particularly devastating was Facebook’s enabling role in the genocide against
the Rohingya in Myanmar. Amazingly, the firm managed to repeat that feat two
years later, facilitating another genocide, this time in Ethiopia’s Tigray
region. Facebook’s role in both was entirely avoidable and a direct result of
the firm’s aggressive persuit of growth, with zero consideration given to actual
social impact. Real communities that still thrive on the social network cannot
compensate for the fact that Facebook is a blight on humanity and that all its
employees, particularly executives have blood on their hands. Its continued
existence points to an inhuman hollowness of capitalism <i lang=fr>à
l’américaine</i>. It also raises grave doubts about this country’s actual
commitment to human rights.</p>

<p>However, the primary reason that Facebook consumed much of my attention for
years <em>after</em> I quit working there was the serendipitous discovery of
compelling evidence that the firm was <a
href="/blog/2022/wrong-impression">defrauding customers, investors, and
regulators alike</a> by artificially inflating <em>the</em> most fundamental
advertising metric, ad impressions. Mind you, I had some fascinating
conversations with reporters at The New York Times, several partners of a tier-2
law firm specializing in regulatory enforcement (which happens to represent
Rupert Murdoch and Fox), and the Federal Trade Commission. Then again, those
conversations were rather frustrating. The bits that the Times and law firm
shared with me after due diligence were denials from institutional advertisers
that anything might be amiss; the <abbr>FTC</abbr> didn’t even bother with that
courtesy. All the same, I not only had the receipts but also independent
confirmation from another industry insider.</p>

<p>Working out that apparent contradiction took a while. I tell the full story
<a href="/blog/2022/wrong-impression">in another blog post</a>. It boils down to
institutional advertisers having their own data feeds that bypass significant
parts of Facebook’s advertising platform. That limits the defrauded to
individuals and small businesses mostly. Apparently, they lack the clout for
making Times, law firm and <abbr>FTC</abbr> to spring into action. As this
episode vividly illustrates, the trope of self-serving and corrupt elites so
often invoked by right-wing populists is firmly grounded in manifest reality.
Alas, their reaction to that observation, trying to blame migrants, Black and
Brown people, and the <abbr>LGBT</abbr> community, is utterly depraved and puts
them firmly into the “most likely to commit genocide” fringe of humanity. Yet
despite their shared interests, right-wing populists don’t seem to like
Facebook. Go figure!</p>

<p>I had been so repulsed by Facebook’s total lack of ethics, I simply stopped
going to work. When after three weeks nobody had inquired about my whereabouts,
I trekked to the office one last time and resigned. Shortly thereafter, my
adoption of Prince David was approved, thanks to the support of a good friend,
who had mentioned him to me after giving him his first shots, and his foster
mom, who had picked up on Esteban and me not being the happiest and had just the
kitten to stir shit up.</p>

<p>Well, plus the Landmarks Preservation Commission: In a case of obvious
clairvoyance, they had declared the outside facade of my home one of those
landmarkajigs in 1977, a perfect 42 years before that status resolved an impasse
about window screens, or the lack thereof, during my adoption of Prince David.
The crazy cat ladies holding the monopoly on cat adoptions in the city wisely
defer to that super-commission as the one exception to the rules. But please
don’t mock them for it. Making an exception can’t be easy for people who are so
unyielding in their rule enforcement they make German government bureaucrats
weep with joy at having found their soulmates. In other words, as a German, I
get them.</p>

</figure>

<p>With the renewal of the royal household thusly secured, I brought the
<em>royal maniac</em>—Esteban really picked the perfect nickname for David—home
with me the weekend of <cite>Gay Pride 2019</cite>. Channeling his predecessor,
he too immediately vanished under the sofa and didn’t re-emerge until the next
day. Similarly, he made the hallway closet one of his favorite hideouts. Several
large, bubble-wrapped frames form a padded ledge behind all the coats. It had
been King Arthur’s favorite hideout and it is a favorite of Prince David’s too.
Alas, to fully claim the mantle of rulership, David still needs to join the
royal sleephold (<em>not</em> sleeper hold) and, so far, he uses the bed only
when I am not in it, which is a clear violation of the compact establishing the
royal line.</p>
</div>

<p>Esteban—if you remember the cat this remembrance is about when I am not busy
decrying Facebook’s neoimperialist exploitation of the global south—had
distinctly ambivalent feelings about the royal renewal until the end of his
life. Sure, it made for a more eventful household while also bringing
opportunities for curling up into or next to another feline. But Prince David
also is the feline equivalent of a bro who gets off on pointless displays of
cattility, like racing the apartment from one end to another, jumping up along
door frames, or relentlessly pursuing aging feline supermodels who have the
great misfortune of living in the same environs. In other words, David, like
most bros, just doesn’t know when to stop.</p>

<p>As told by Esteban, aging feline supermodel, the royal renewal has made the
journey from sleeping quarters in the royal sleephold to dining hall singularly
treacherous. The door of linens used to be nicely shut and serve as one of the
landmarks when crossing the canyon of closets. Nowadays, however, the door of
linen is open more often than not. Not only does this obstruct the journey, but
hidden inside may just lurk the royal maniac. So Esteban approaches gingerly and
peeks around the open door. On a good day, the royal maniac is busy elsewhere
and, once Esteban crossed the canyon of closets, it is an easy jaunt to a nice,
relaxed meal. On a bad day, the royal maniac is right there behind the door of
linens. That means Esteban’s meal plans are out of the window and he better
start running for dear life to his protector, the furless giant. On a terrible
day, the furless giant is nowhere to be found when one needs him most. Moments
later, one can feel the royal berserker landing on one’s back. Then his teeth
and claws sink in. Then… Esteban falters in his story and, after taking a moment
to collect himself, insists that he just doesn’t remember. And besides, he’d
rather talk about something completely different, such as the French
Revolution.</p>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Breaking and Entering</h2>

<p>Since we are on the topic of doors: One evening a couple of months after the
royal renewal, David was watching me search through drawers in the main
bathroom. I noticed his curiosity and focus but didn’t think much of it. The
next day, after I returned from work, I found most drawers pulled open. From
that day on, David practiced his drawer opening skills every day. A few weeks
later, I observed David pull one drawer open, climb inside, pull the drawer
closed from inside, and after a dramatic pause emerge from another, different
drawer again. While he has grown too big to still crawl behind the drawers,
David continues to inspect their contents with some regularity. Since the larger
bottom brawer happens to have clothes in it, it continues to serve as the royal
trundle should David tire in its vicinity.</p>

<p>From drawers to cupboard doors, from cupboard doors to closet and room doors,
and from inside doors to the apartment door, David kept on practicing for months
and thereby kept on opening new levels of territorial reach. I was duly
impressed. But I also wasn’t so keen on the aftermath of David’s thorough
explorations. Thankfully, I can count some straight couples with children as
friends. Apparently, they face similar problems with their own, human spawn.
Proving that straight people can be clever too, they developed a deterrent,
something called “child safety lock.” Fascinatingly, they even have stores
dedicated to selling such gizmos. After a friend told me about all this, I
immediately bought several of these gizmos and can attest that they have been
100% effective at keeping David out of closets and the second bedroom. Except I
didn’t put locks on the coat and linen closets. David still uses them.
Surprisingly, these child safety locks also are rather effective at keeping
other gay men out of rooms.</p>

<p>Given his rapid progress, I should have expected that David would tackle the
apartment door as well. But that door is <em>obviously</em> different—beyond
being made from steel and hence quite a bit heavier than the others. It also
marks the boundary between mine and not so much mine. King intuitively
understood and respected that difference. Esteban and David not so much. If they
can get there, it’s theirs. It’s almost as if they don’t believe in individual
ownership of property. Since that take on ownership appears to be common amongst
cats, I find it surprising that so many Americans cohabitate with them. After
all, Americans are prone to hysterical fits, even seizures, at the mere mention
of “socialism.” And then they are voluntarily living with committed socialists.
It’s all very strange. While I am sympathetic to the cause, I have to balance my
revolutionary designs with good neighborly relations. Hence, just like King, I
subscribe to the distinction between inside the apartment and outside the
apartment. Unfortunately for Esteban and David, I also impose that view onto my
room mates.</p>

<p>That’s probably why David waited until I was travelling to Germany in early
February 2020 before staging his first apartment break. Once he realized I
wasn’t coming back for the night, he probably started working the door until he
worked it open. My catsitter texted me in the morning about finding both cats in
the hallway, with the door wide open. Despite being pretty darn certain that I
pulled the door closed, I convinced myself that I must have forgotten to do just
that in my rush to get to the airport. David disabused me of that notion shortly
after my return when he proudly gave a paw-on demonstration of his latest skill.
By now, opening the front door has become so routine, it takes him a few seconds
at most.</p>

<p>Alas, if you think about it, only a little, that’s not where the story ends.
It simply can’t. And it didn’t. After all, there clearly is one more door to
unlock, at least while remaining on the 15<sup>th</sup> floor: Our neighbors’
doors! Huh? One more door is neighbor’s doors, plural? How does that work? I’d
say that from a knowledge and skills perspective, there really is only one more
door on the floor. The one that leads from not so much mine to truly theirs.
Amazingly, Prince David realized that transference of knowledge himself, without
prompting or help from anyone including me. Unfortunately, he picked the worst
possible time for his first and, so far, only attempt.</p>

<p>The pandemic hit New York City right after my return and it hard,
devastatingly hard. For the months of March and April 2020, the city became the
global epicenter for covid. It brought the city that never sleeps<sup>u</sup>
came to a near total standstill, with anyone who could cooped up at home and
opening their door only well after the hapless delivery person had left again. I
live at one of the busier intersections in Brooklyn, next to a commuter rail
station, and above a subway station where ten different lines meet. There always
is <em>some</em> noise outside. Day or night. Not so during those two
months.</p>

<p>The city had fallen silent, completely, oppressively silent. The only
noticeable sounds were the daily banging of pots and pans to honor first
responders and medical personnel—and the wailing of ambulances when yet another
wretched soul was rushed off to a hospital with uncertain prospects of survival.
In early March, the wailing happened sporadically and mostly during daytime. By
end of April, it still happened intermittently but all the time, day and night.
Over those two months, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_New_York_City">covid
killed over 15,000 New Yorkers</a>. By comparison, it would take another twenty
months for covid to kill the next 15,000 residents. No wonder then that
refrigerated trucks to hold the bodies of the recently deceased were standing
outside every single healthcare facility.</p>

<p>I spent my days obsessing over the latest news about covid and my nights
communing with the ghosts of friends who died from <abbr>AIDS</abbr> some
decades ago. That way, my first and second pandemic increasingly became one and
the same, a continuum of deadly viral infections. I would have lost all sense of
time if it wasn’t for the daily banging of pots and pans. It startled me,
surprised me more than once. How can it be 24 hours later? Really? Yup, they are
banging on metal again. Another day. And so, the daily banging of pots and pans
became a rather coarse clock for me and also served as helpful tether to the
space time continuum. Or manifest reality as I usually call it.</p>

<p>To drive home the point of how strange those two months were in New York
City, consider this: One late Friday evening in April, I decided to explore the
space part of the continuum and went on walk-about through Manhattan, leisurely
trekking from the <abbr>AIDS</abbr> memorial in Greenwich Village along
7<sup>th</sup> Avenue past Madison Square Garden and through Times Square,
continuing along Broadway up to 58<sup>th</sup> Street. The apocalypse had
finally, actually happened and the city that never sleeps had ceased to exist. I
wouldn’t have been surprised had I run into Snake Plissken in this New New York
City. But I also didn’t really need him. I never felt unsafe. Even though, over
the three hours walking the lower third of Manhattan, I saw at most 30 humans
total. On a Friday night. In Manhattan.</p>

<p>Actually, I must admit that I quite like Times Square when its so utterly
devoid of people. I enjoy watching those hyper-aggressive animated billboards
perform not for the benefit of tourons but for themselves. They are not just
whiling the days away until the inevitable moment when the electricity cuts out.
They are giving the performances of their digital existence, with intensity and
exuberance. Plus, I didn’t take the sidewalk; I got to walk in the middle of the
street all night.</p>
</div>

<p>During another night a couple of days before or after, as I said time was
rather elastic, I had been sitting on the floor outside my apartment, face mask
on, reading and listening to music on my headphones. The cats were roaming about
in the hallway, with at least Esteban leisurely sniffing everything. When I
noticed some unusual movement to my far left and turned my head, I saw Prince
David performing pull-ups off 15H’s doorhandle—just what he does when opening a
door. At 2am in the morning. When <abbr>NYC</abbr> is the global epicenter of
the covid pandemic.</p>

<p>My heart skipped a beat. I could already picture me being arrested half an
hour later and the police officers openly ridiculing me for maintaining that I
didn’t do it but my cat did. I was also running down the hallway and did so
faster than I thought possible. When I got to the door, oh yeah, I discovered
with great relief that the door was still locked.  Esteban really picked the
perfect nickname when he started calling David the royal maniac.</p>

<p>By now, it probably won’t surprise you to hear that Esteban’s eating habbits
were somewhat different from those of other cats as well. Esteban always very
fond of plants. That made owning them difficult because he would dig them out to
play with them and, maybe, eat them too. He’d go wild over cut flowers. I once
hosted a birthday party for a friend at my place and many of his friends brought
flowers. We had lock them into the second bedroom because Esteban was
enthusiastically tearing into them. As a result of his antics, I got really good
building wire coverings for planters that were sufficiently sturdy to withstands
Esteban’s persistent attempts at removing them again, yet gave the plant enough
space to flourish. Alas, flourishing is hard for plants when faced with my own
<i lang=fr>laissez-faire</i> attitudes towards plant care and Esteban’s
persistent attacks. Still, over the years, a ficus tree found that environment
eminently suitable to its well-being and managed to grow from 0.5m off-the-rack
plant to a real tree standing tall at over 2m. For the longest time, Esteban ate
a leave or two per month and after throwing it up again a short time later left
the tree alone for a while. But then he started eating leaves and throwing up
leaves every single day. So I gifted the tree to my building’s super, who wanted
one for the large, open space in his living room. Alas, that space had too
little light and Yuri, despite his amazing skills with anything mechanical, was
even worse at plant care than me. Mr Ficus did not survive.</p>

<p>Overall, Esteban wasn’t a fussy eater. He loved treats but ate both wet and
dry food. Strangely for a cat, Esteban had a pronounced sweet tooth. That much
became clear when I found him eating the granulated sugar directly from the
bowl. If he noticed that I was pouring myself a bowl of cereal, he’d follow me
and wait right next to me for his turn to lick the by now sweet milk from the
bowl. If I took too long eating, he’d get impatient, paw at me, and eventually
just push forward towards the bowl. During his last two weeks, friends stopped
by to say their farewells. Karin’s visit started with all three of us sitting on
the floor but, as Karin and I were talking, Esteban was curiously absent, not
begging for treats when he was clearly always hungry. Then I remembered. I was
still eating breakfast when Karin arrived and had just prepared a large slice of
bread with butter and honey. So I got up and checked: Plate and slice of bread
were still where I left them. The butter and honey had been cleanly licked off
the bred.</p>

<p>

try to stick his head
into the bowl. On the few occasions that I had dinner guests, he’d be on the
dining table right away and, when we weren’t paying attention to him, move inch
by inch closer to the food.

</p>


<p>For 16 out of the 19 years, Esteban and I lived together, there was a second
cat in the household. But the one I had to look out for when it came to eating
plants, eating sugary things, drinking out of toilet bowls, sneaking up on food
on the dinner table, it was always Esteban. Sure, the royals have their own
ticks and obsessions that require accommodation. King Arthur never approved of
me travelling and expressed his disappointment in me doing so by peeing on beds
and throwing up onto keyboards. Prince David’s skills at opening drawers,
cupboards, and doors have resulted in a surplus of secondary locking mechanisms
throughout my apartment. But when it comes to the little things, to quotidian
matters such as food or drink, the one being who had the most impact on me is
Esteban, always Esteban.</p>

<p>Still, credit where credit is due: King managed to refine expressions of his
feelings about my travels to impressive demonstrations of anger and
disappointment. His early efforts, such as peeing on bed, were relatively
coarse. In response to my countermeasures, always using rubber bedsheets under
regular sheets and locking comforters into the closet while away, he made his
demonstrations more personally targeted, notably by throwing up on my rather
expensive <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/">ergonomic
keyboard</a>. Of course, I added the replacement keyboard to the inventory of
items to lock in the closet before travelling. So, his final and most impressive
demonstration was to pee on the packed duffel, leaving a puddle of piss on top,
but without spilling a single drop down the sides of the bag or onto the floor.
And he did that <em>after</em> I had returned from a 24-hour sojourn to the
Jersey Shore, which I had purposefully kept that short because of him. Now,
that’s artistry!</p>

<p>Even when throwing up Esteban was different. Most cats just throw up close to
where they happen to be. Not so Esteban. First, he would announce that he was
about to throw up. Imagine a sound somewhere between <a rel=noreferrer
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHCmzvzCmhI">foghorn</a> and Cher intoning
”<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZXRV4MezEw&t=59">be-lie-ie-ie-ve</a>”
in her eponymous song. Next, Esteban would usually seek out the carpet in the
entrance area. Finally, Esteban would throw up. So if I wanted to prevent him
from throwing up somewhere inopportune, I had about three to five seconds from
him sounding the alarm. Here too, I adjusted. When it came time to replace the
sisal entrance runner, I upgraded to Chilewich. Over the last year of his life,
Esteban added an occasional variation that I found puzzling. The first time this
happened I heard the alarm from the kitchen area but was preoccupied with work.
When I looked for the puke a while later, I couldn’t find it. Chances of a false
alarm seemed zero. Finally, I realized that the food bowls had been filled.

<h2>Friend, Compañero</h2>

<p>It all started 19 years ago when I picked up Esteban based on a found ad and
gave him the space to pick me too. I started out by describing his view of the
relationship as me becoming his bitch that day. That word seemed safest without
anthropomorphizing the cat. Besides being suffocatingly heteronormative, it too
is wholly inaccurate because—ignoring that one, short time he licked my right
nipple while my then partner licked my left one—our relationship never was
sexual. The often made claim that we humans only are servants to our cats
doesn’t help much either. In fact, it is the worst kind of observation, one that
purports to be clever when in reality it only obfuscates: What opportunities for
self-sufficient life present themselves to an indoor cat living on the, say,
27<sup>th</sup> or 15<sup>th</sup> floor of a <abbr>NYC</abbr> apartment
building? We take care of our pets because we put them in an environment where
they depend on us. The same is true for toddlers, but we don’t usually accuse
them of abusing us as servants. Maybe because the vast majority of them grow
beyond the cognitive acumen of a three-or-so-year-old and have opposable thumbs
all along. Cats usually do not. The point: Even under analytical scrutiny, I
cannot but see a mutual relationship, with both me and Esteban having
experienced sincere companionship. It may have lacked the intellectual or carnal
pleasures always present as a human-to-human potential. But likewise, it came
without all the added complications of most human relationships. That’s a
special companionship, one that even between humans tends to be limited to very
few, very close friends.</p>

<p>That companionship turns into a heavy burden during sickness, Esteban’s
sickness to be precise. How to do right by him when he won’t talk, when there is
no consent, let alone informed consent, when watching him for clues is akin to
reading tea leaves because there is little behavioral difference between “it’s
bad but I can manage” and “I can’t anymore.” I got a first taste of that about
two years ago. Esteban had been diagnosed with kidney disease some months
before. That would have been manageable if he would eat the special renal diet.
But he never warmed up to it. I tried every single flavor of every single brand
I could get my hands on. He maybe picked at it. But he never ate it all.
Meanwhile, he was losing weight at borderline dangerous rate. After yet another
vet visit charting that precipitous decline, I gave up on trying to manage his
kidney disease. If he’s gonna go, I’d rather have him enjoy his final
year—because if that decline had continued, he wouldn’t have made it through the
year. He did make it. And he did enjoy it. When I announced to the vet a year
later that we didn’t follow their recommendations at all, quite the opposite,
she was taken aback at first but agreed that he had stabilized. The blood work
confirmed that his kidney disease hadn’t progressed much either. Alas, it also
added another diagnosis: Hyperthyrodism. Properly medicated, that disease too is
manageable. But again, manageability was hard to come by. The pills made Esteban
throw up every few days, which isn’t particularly helpful for a cat who is
already too thin. So we switched to a creme to be rubbed into his ear. In that
case, the vet’s unrealistic instructions interfered with my unsteady sleeping
schedule of late. When I finally found a rhythm that worked for me and him,
during his last vet visit a few months ago, she noticed a lump in his cheek.
When I heard that word.</p>





<p>Making the call to ease Esteban’s suffering was even harder than for King. I
had already made an appointment with one vet and cancelled it again. I tried a
second time and couldn’t follow through. But over that week, Esteban also got
worse. He slept only once with me in bed. So I found another vet who makes house
visits and made the appointment. For my birthday. At 2pm. Esteban and I spent
the time around noon listening to Benjamin Britten’s War Requiem. He was so
miserable, I had to lift him up onto bed. But once there, he curled up into me
and lasted until the <i lang=la>Libera Me</i> That cut too close. Then Cordula
came, the doctor arrived, Ako came, and

</p>



<hr>

<p>It’s been over a month since Esteban’s passing. I still start sobbing at the
most opportune and inopportune times. Working on this remembrance took
everything out of me at times and more often than not left me in tears. Whether
on the street, smoking and taking notes, or on the subway, writing furiously on
my phone, I may end up crying—or sobbing even. I’ve gotten used to it. But I’m
not sure New Yorkers know what to do when faced with a grown man in tears. Alas,
with climate change turning our only habitat into Hell on Earth and us still
sitting idly by, with this month on track to become the hottest month on record,
easily beating last month from its record-setting place, such <em>public
displays of despair</em> will only get more frequent and it’s only a question of
time until you will join me, too. My advise: Don’t hold back, show your anger,
show your grief. Business as usual will get you nowhere.</p>

<p>I am heartbroken. I miss Esteban so much. You were one special fella and the
best companion I could ask for for almost two decades. I am so sorry that the
last few months of your life were so hard, that nothing could satiate the hunger
you were clearly feeling, that pain became a constant. I did what I could and I
hope you forgive me for easing your passing to the <i>Great Catnip Fields</i>.
Thank you! Really: <em>Thank you!</em></p>
