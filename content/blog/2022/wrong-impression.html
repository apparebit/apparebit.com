<section aria-labelledby=introduction>
<h2 id=introduction hidden>Introduction</h2>

<p>On <time datetime=2019-03-19>19 March, 2019</time> in the early afternoon, I
was at my desk in the New York city engineering office of Meta née Facebook and
checking the status of my advertising campaigns. (Since I focus on events that
largely predate the rebranding, I’ll stick with Facebook.) As an advertising
company, Facebook encourages its employees to conduct their own advertising
campaigns and supports those efforts with monthly advertising credits. I had
been using those credits to boost posts on Instagram, while also experimenting
with the composition of target audiences. Since advertising metrics still felt
somewhat alien to me despite more than six months at the firm, I decided to look
up basic metrics, notably <em>ad impressions</em>, on the firm’s wiki. I was
about to discover compelling evidence that Facebook was artificially inflating
that very metric and thereby misleading paying customers and investors
alike.</p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby=public>
<h2 id=public>Public Impressions</h2>

<p>Before we get to what I found, let’s make sure we understand what ad
impressions are and what role they play in Facebook’s business. To get started,
we turn to the <cite>Facebook Business Suite</cite>. The smartphone app is an
indispensable tool for creating and monitoring ads on Facebook. In <time
datetime=2021-10-27>October 2021</time>, the app’s builtin help defined ad
impressions thusly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The number of times your ads were on screen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, an impression only happens when an ad is displayed on screen.
That makes sense. But it also leaves unspecified who, if anyone, looks at that
screen. Let’s dig a little deeper. Since Facebook is a publicly traded company,
it must make regular filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or
<abbr>SEC</abbr>. Those filings matter because they help regulators and
investors understand a company’s business and evaluate its future prospects.</p>

<p>The quarterly and yearly reports covering the day I made my discovery are <a
href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001326801/000132680119000037/fb-03312019x10q.htm">form
10-Q</a> as filed with the <abbr>SEC</abbr> on <time datetime=2019-04-25>April
25, 2019</time> and <a
href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001326801/000132680120000013/fb-12312019x10k.htm">form
10-K</a> as filed on <time datetime=2020-01-30>January 30, 2020</time>. Both
filings contain a section titled <cite>Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations</cite> and also a subheading
<cite>Components of Results of Operations — Revenue</cite>. That’s where the
firm’s management, foremost <abbr>CEO</abbr> Mark Zuckerberg, spell out how they
understand the business they are in and how that business generates its revenue.
The first two paragraphs, labelled <em>Advertising</em>, are identical in both
filings and read (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our
advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook,
Instagram, Messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile
applications. <em>Marketers pay</em> for ad products either directly or through
their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, <em>based on the
number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks,
taken</em> by users.</p>

<p>We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the
contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. <em>Impressions are
considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user.</em> We recognize
revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user
takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number of ads we show is
subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and
the structure of our ads products. We calculate price per ad as total ad revenue
divided by the number of ads delivered, <em>representing the effective price
paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as
impression or action</em>. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not
the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short: Facebook generates almost all revenue through advertising, which
maximizes either impressions or actions. Impressions requires display of the ad
to human users. Impressions also are the more fundamental metric, with price
per impression reported for all ads.</p>

<p>Two years later, that still is management’s explanation for Facebook’s
revenue. In its <a
href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680122000018/fb-20211231.htm">most
recent 10-K</a>, filed with the <abbr>SEC</abbr> on <time
datetime=2022-02-03>February 3, 2022</time>, the firm’s management use a
whittled down first paragraph, but still makes the same three points.</p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby=internal>
<h2 id=internal>Internal Impressions</h2>

<figure>

     alt="A computer screen showing Facebook’s internal wiki on ad impressions">
<figcaption>An impressive definition of impressions.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Alas, Facebook’s actual, technical definition is substantially different:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Facebook uses a specific definition for an external impression: the number of
times a unit was on screen. This is technically defined as 1x1 pixel of a post
or piece of content in a user’s viewport, for >0 than seconds. (We don’t reveal
this definition externally.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My use of the present tense in this section is no mistake. This definition
remains Facebook’s actual technical definition of ad impressions to this day.
The only thing that has changed is that Facebook started <a rel=noreferrer
href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/785455638255832">sharing that
definition</a> with the outside world in <time datetime=2019-09>September
2019</time>. The page has an embedded view counter, but with today’s count at
928 smaller than the 1,381 on my last visit on <time
datetime=2021-10-31>Halloween</time> last year, I have some reservations about
the counter’s accuracy.</p>
</section>

<section aria-labelledby=mine>
<h2 id=mine>My Impressions</h2>

<p>I have a few observations about Facebook’s technical definition of ad
impressions.</p>

<ol class=drop-count role=list>

<li>This definition gives Facebook tremendous latitude in delivering ad
impressions. In a worst case for advertisers, Facebook claims that it delivered
some number <var>n</var> of ad impressions, when in manifest reality it delivered
only <var>n</var> corner pixels. Then again, maybe it delivered all <var>n</var>
ad impressions in their entirety.</li>

<li>There is no technical reason that might justify such a loose definition.
Determining the visible rectangle of some view element is straight-forward for
applications running on the <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19032261/how-to-get-scroll-views-visible-rectangle-frame-after-it-scrolls-in-ios">iOS</a>
and <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9073677/android-get-the-visible-area-of-a-view">Android</a>
operating systems. It used to be slightly more complicated for <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/123999/how-can-i-tell-if-a-dom-element-is-visible-in-the-current-viewport">web
browsers</a>. But that has become straight-forward too.</li>

<li>The parenthetical makes clear that the authors had some awareness of this
definition being problematic. Why else add such a suggestive parenthetical? At
the same time, the very presence of the parenthetical creates an impression of
fraudulent intent. Since the wiki is widely accessible within the firm, that
implies that other employees are expected to be similarly morally
compromised.</li>

<li>The self-serving definition of ad impressions as much as the withholding of
that definition raise significant doubts about Facebook’s trustworthiness and
reliability when it comes to even the most basic aspects of its advertising
platform. Yet thanks to microtargeting, it also is nearly impossible to audit
the performance of ads from outside the firm. Plus, Facebook has a history of
<a
href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/09/21/facebook-rolls-out-news-feed-change-that-blocks-watchdogs-from-gathering-data">disabling
auditing tools</a> as well as <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/opinion/facebook-misinformation.html">deplatforming
auditors</a>.</li>

<li>Nonetheless, Facebook continues peddling the fantasy of meaningful ad
impressions in its regulatory filings and on its advertising platform. While the
firm did disclose the self-serving and arbitrary nature of the metric

the strong impression of fraudulent intent. Since the wiki is widely shared
within the firm, the authors also expect others to be equally compromised.


that implies an expectation that other employees are as
morally compromised as the authors.

impression of fraudulent intent. Why else add such a suggestive parenthetical?

  The
authors of the wiki entry clearly had some awareness of how problematic that
technical definition is. Why else add such a compromising parenthetical? Yet
they are also counting on the fact that readers are as morally compromised as
the authors and will abide by the exhortation.</li>

from outside of the firm, Facebook’s ad impressions are meaningless.</li>

<li>Facebook nonetheless continues with its fantasy of meaningful ad impressions
in its regulatory filings. The cognitive dissonance between actual and fantasy
ad impressions again eliminates plausible deniability: There is no mistake here,
only fraudulent intent.</li>

<li>The parenthetical only underlines that contention. The authors of the wiki
entry obviously had some awareness of how problematic that technical definition
is. Why else add such a compromising parenthetical? At the same time, they were
also counting on an internal culture that values keeping the firm’s secrets far
higher than even remotely ethical behavior.</li>
